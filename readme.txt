== Description ==

Registers a raw html block which uses the ACE Editor. Features include syntax highligting, line numbers, indentation, and HTML validation.
Under the hood it uses react-ace (https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace).

Any HTML markup included in your block will be interpreted and rendered on your user-facing page or post just like the core "Custom HTML" block. This plugin is not for embedding pretty markup on your front-end site, rather it is for those developers that need to include raw HTML in their pages or posts and want to improve the readablility of their HTML snippets and have a better in-browser code editing experience.
